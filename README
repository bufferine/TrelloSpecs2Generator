Test code spike, interrogates Trello using Dispatch, and can use that to generate a specs test template file from the board/lists/cards/checklists/checklistitems.

Re-running will add any new stuff from Trello, but won't overwrite anything already written

You need to edit and add your keys/secrets/etc at the top before it runs at the moment as everything is hardcoded. Once you've done that, you can use it like so:

      import com.redvblack.dispatch.trello._
      val specs = Trello.loadExistingSpecs
      val board = Trello.loadBoard
      val comparison = Trello.compareSpecToBoard(specs, board)
      Trello.insertIntoSpec(specs, board, comparison)
