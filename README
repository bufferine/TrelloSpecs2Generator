Test code spike, interrogates Trello using Dispatch, and can use that to generate a specs test template file from the board/lists/cards/checklists/checklistitems.

Re-running will add any new stuff from Trello, but won't overwrite anything already written

You need to create a <homedirectory>/.trello file with your token and key (see below for example), update the package/project paths and filenames then once you've done that, you can use it like so:

      import com.redvblack.dispatch.trello._
      Trello.generateOrUpdate

.trello:
  
   key=yourkey
   token=yourtoken
